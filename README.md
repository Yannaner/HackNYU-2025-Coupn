# Coupn: America's Solution's to Credit Card Debt

Coupn is built to help you save money by finding promo codes hidden in your email. We noticed many people ignore promo emails and existing promo code tools just don’t work. Coupn fixes that by automatically scanning your promotion emails, finding the best deals, and showing them to you—all in a simple, easy-to-use format.

## What Is Coupn?

Coupn grabs your promotion emails from your inbox and looks through every part of the email to find the promo codes and messages you need. We use smart image processing and natural language tools to scan the email, even when it’s filled with up to 30 colorful images. With Coupn, you no longer have to search through long emails or rely on unreliable browser extensions.

## How It Works

- **Email Fetching:** Coupn automatically pulls in your promotion emails. No more missing out on deals because you forgot to check your inbox.
- **Image & Text Processing:** Our tool goes through all the images and text in each email. It finds the promo code by looking at every detail, even when the email is busy with multiple images.
- **Big Language Model:** We switched from OpenAI to Gemini because Gemini can handle long emails with many images. This upgrade gives us a huge context window so that no promo code goes unnoticed.
- **Voice Commands:** You can also use your voice. Just say, "Hey Coupn, I want to go grocery shopping, what promos are available?" and Coupn will show you the best deals for grocery shopping.
- **Secure Backend with Supabase:** All the data is stored and processed securely using Supabase, which makes the whole process fast and reliable.

## The Problem We Solved

Promotion emails are often ignored, and even when people do check them, it’s hard to pick out the useful deals. Here’s what we noticed:

- **Cluttered Emails:** A typical promo email is filled with many images and long texts. This clutter makes it hard to find the actual promo code.
- **Unreliable Tools:** Existing promo code tools and browser extensions are often inaccurate or just don’t work.
- **Wasting Time:** Users spend too much time scrolling through emails and clicking on wrong codes, which means they miss out on real savings.

Coupn tackles these problems by using advanced tools to sift through the clutter and deliver only the best deals.

## Overcoming Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was dealing with the busy design of promo emails. With up to 30 images per email, figuring out which image holds the promo code was like finding a needle in a haystack. We solved this by:

- **Using Gemini:** Gemini gives us a massive context window—up to one million tokens—which means it can process very long emails accurately. This made it possible to extract the promo code even from the most image-heavy emails.
- **Combining Techniques:** By using both image processing and natural language processing, we ensured that we capture both the visual and text parts of the email. This dual approach is what makes Coupn so effective.
